Getting Started
===============

The GC-1000-GPS is a drop-in replacement board for the GC-1000 radio disciplined clock, giving
some life and utility back to your super accurate radio synchronized clock!


Where to start?
---------------

Once you have a kit, check out the :ref:`Assemble the GC-1000-GPS` section 
to begin the process of installing and configuring your board for the first time!


Extra tidbits
-------------

* Original Manual + schematics :download:`pdf <../../gc-1000-gps/docs/Heathkit_GC1000H_Accurate_Clock_(schematic).pdf>`.
* `PRC68.com/Brooke Clarke`_ has some interesting time disecting their gc-1000 and the info was very helpful for making this project.
