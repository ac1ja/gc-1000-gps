Getting Started
===============

Welcome! These docs are still in the early stages of being completed, but theres still some useful information present!

the GC-1000-GPS project aims to upgrade your existing GC-1000 heathkit time sync using GPS to generate a time syncronizaton for your radio.

Some important things you may want:

* Original Manual + schematics :download:`pdf <../../gc-1000-gps/docs/Heathkit_GC1000H_Accurate_Clock_(schematic).pdf>`.
* `PRC68.com/Brooke Clarke`_ has some interesting time disecting their gc-1000 and the info was very helpful for making this project.
